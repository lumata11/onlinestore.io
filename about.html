<h2>About</h2>

<p>
    If someone ever tells you that it's too early to be eating cake,
    cut them off because you don't need that kind of negativity in your life!
    And while you don't need an excuse to eat cakes and bakes from The Cakey Bakey.
    Choose from a selection of sponge flavours (like red velvet cake or chocolate cake) and decorations to find the perfect birthday cake or baby shower cake.
    Some designs are simple and tasteful, and others are more extravagant and elegant.
